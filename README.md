I am an open-source software enthusiast and loves to contribute to the community. 

I started my OSS journey with contributions to the [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech) project and became part of the core team. 

Nowadays, I am focused on the [JHipster Svelte](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-svelte) blueprint to generate production-ready JHipster applications with [Svelte/Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev) as a frontend framework.
